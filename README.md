# Quickbooks sync service in .Net

This is my implementation of "Quickbooks API integrations" to sync QuickBooks with a third party.

# Features!

  - Quickbooks handshake and token generation.
  
You can also:
  - Store tokens in a RavenDB

### Tech

THis implementataion use nuber of nugets to work properly:

* [Intuite] - Intuit Developer Portal
* [RavenDB] - Raven 3.5
* [NewtonsoftJson] - Newtonsoft json
* [NgRok] - Generate https public urls for loacalhost testing


### Installation

- You will need to signup for intuitive developer portal and create an app.
- Replace the clientId and ClientSercret in the web.conf file.
- change the redirect URL of the app and in the app in developer portal. (This is where NgRok comes to play!).


### Todos

 - Write MORE Tests
